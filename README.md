# Waffel

Static site generation done ~~right~~ _tasty_.

Yet another static generator, here to help you with more concrete use cases than just _your personal blog_.

## Getting Started

I strongly recommend you to use Waffel with [Brunch](http://brunch.io/), starting with the [brunch-with-waffel](https://github.com/moonwave99/brunch-with-waffel) skeleton:

    # in case you do not have Brunch installed yet
    $ npm install brunch -g

    $ brunch new path/to/project --skeleton https://github.com/moonwave99/brunch-with-waffel
    $ cd path/to/project
    $ npm install
    $ bower install
    $ npm start

Visit [`http://localhost:3333`](http://localhost:3333) and you ready to go!

Please have a look at the examples here above or at [the doc](http://moonwave99.github.io/waffel/docs/), in order to get a better grasp on how can Waffel be useful to you.

## FAQ

> Does Waffel work with different front matter formats (e.g. JSON, TOML,â€¦) rather than YAML?

Not at the moment, though I would be glad to [receive a PR](https://github.com/moonwave99/waffel) in order to make front matter format configurable!

> Is there any CLI tool?

No, because [brunch](http://brunch.io/), [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) all make a wonderful job at that.

> Does Waffel handle the compilation/concatenation/minification of my CSS/JS code?

No, because [brunch](http://brunch.io/), [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) and [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) all make a wonderful job at that.

> Can I change template language?

Not at the moment, because I like [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/)'s expressiveness a lot, and the possibility to **chain filters** (that allows me to use more logic in templates, since there is no controller layer actually).

> Does Waffel provide support for a complex relational model?

Waffel doesn't know anything about your data schema. But as all the loaded data is exposed in the templates via the `data` property, you can deal with any sort of composition (e.g. `data.users[post.author]`). It is the price to pay for not having to write a schema, but I don't find it very expensive : ))

In case you really need a complex query mechanism, chances are that you need a different stack.

> Are there plugins? Is there a way to write any?

Writing a plugin for such a specific tool usually ends up in following a narrow DSL, with no real benefit on top of the hassle.  
You can include even complicate **filters** and **helpers**, that can be used all over the HTML template codes.

Nevertheless, have a look at the examples up here, they may help you to achieve your goal!
